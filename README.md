# Save-Current-Time

I'm often taking screenshots of the time on my phone in order to measure the amount of time I spent doing something. For example, when I leave school I'll take a screenshot of the time, to calculate how long my commute took. 

This program saves the current time. To use just run it on terminal with: 


>$g++ main.cpp Account.cpp CurrentTimePost.cpp 

>$./a.out 


The program prompts the user to enter a message to keep track of why they are saving the the current time. 
Once the message is entered, it creates a Post of the message and the current time and displays it, along with previous saved time Posts. 




### In the future:
* create Makefile
* allow user to enter their own username
* I want to build an app to host this program using android studio.
